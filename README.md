Prerequisites, if not done already:
- An active I-AM account. https://i-am-technology
- Make sure you scanned the QR code in the email you got when registered with the I-AM App. Available in the Applie and Android stores

To run the application. 

In your I-AM account:
- create an application
- copy the values of the APP_ID, HUB_ID and PRIVATE_KEY 
- in the application - user tab: select your user. This will authorise you to access the application

In the application - AuthContext.tsx update the APP_ID, HUB_ID and PRIVATE_KEY with the values you just copied.
